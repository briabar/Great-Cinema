## Overview

This project is a movie trailer showcasing website that generates itself from python files.  It uses object oriented programming to automatically populate the page with content.  

## How to run

In order to run the program you must have the three files fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py, and entertainment_center.py together in one folder.  Run the entertainment_center.py file in order to automatically generate and open the required html files.  

## Included Files

>entertainment_center.py is where our objects are instantiated and passed into the file...
>fresh_tomatoes.py, which is the bulk of our code and generates our html files.
>media.py is where we have our class prototypes.
